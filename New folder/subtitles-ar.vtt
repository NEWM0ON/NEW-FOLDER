00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.425
Today, let's talk about the request-response cycle or

2
00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:18.675
basically what happens when you type something into the address bar of your browser.

3
00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.830
One of the things I think is really funny and I'm guilty of it as well,

4
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.580
is that we all do things and we have no idea how they work.

5
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.830
So, if I were to ask you when you type in an address, what happens?

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.070
So, this lecture is actually one of the most technical of this entire class.

7
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.129
I don't want to feel like you need to memorize this or write it down,

8
00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.770
but I do think it will help you understand a little bit

9
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.690
more what's going on as you learn HTML5.

10
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.935
So, one of the things you might want to understand is the client-server relationship.

11
00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:55.610
Servers are basically machines that hold all the resources.

12
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.375
Our hope is that they're always connected to the network.

13
00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.830
Clients are what we're using,

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.310
where the machines that you use for personal use;

15
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.445
like laptops, phones, et cetera.

16
00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:09.695
Let me show you in this picture.

17
00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:15.060
It's really common to use networks such as something called a LAN or a WAN.

18
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.890
A LAN is a local area network,

19
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.070
and so what I have right here is this idea that we can have

20
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.410
three different computers and they're all sharing one server.

21
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.590
لماذا نريد أن نفعل ذلك؟

22
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.920
Well, a lot of times,

23
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.565
you only have one printer or one of the different resources.

24
00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:39.215
This way, all three machines can work together and share that one resource.

25
00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:42.355
So, the LAN is the local area network.

26
00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:47.095
Sometimes, you want to have something larger or a wide area network.

27
00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:52.895
So, in movies, where the good guy is breaking into the building to steal the software,

28
00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:56.240
what's typically happened is they have this server that

29
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.280
everyone who works in the building can access but no one outside the building,

30
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.610
or you can even have it across different buildings but you don't

31
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.700
want anyone from the outside to really be able to get your information.

32
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.285
So, local area network is like your office building.

33
00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:13.390
A wide area network might be a university,

34
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.005
where you want to be able to share servers across multiple buildings.

35
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.690
The largest wide area network is, of course, the Internet.

36
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.365
So, now we get back to that question of

37
00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:26.665
what happens when you type something into the URL?

38
00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:30.220
What you're doing is that you the client are requesting

39
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.315
a web page and the server needs to respond with the appropriate files.

40
00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:38.090
So, when you type something in,

41
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.155
this is called the URL.

42
00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:42.645
Every URL has three parts.

43
00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:46.275
The protocol, how you want to connect, the domain,

44
00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:47.744
which is the server,

45
00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:50.725
and then optionally, you can include the document.

46
00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:53.884
So, even though you're typing in one URL,

47
00:02:53.884 --> 00:02:56.180
one of the things to realize is that usually,

48
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.065
you're actually requesting lots and lots of files all at once.

49
00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:03.235
So, the protocols that most people have seen;

50
00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:05.235
the first one is HTTP,

51
00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.395
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

52
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.855
The second one, HTTPS,

53
00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:11.280
is the same idea,

54
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.850
only now we're having a more secure protocol.

55
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.860
So, if you're ever connecting to a bank or any place where you're putting in passwords,

56
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.350
make sure that the first thing you see in that URL is HTTPS.

57
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.925
If you don't, don't connect.

58
00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:30.170
The third one is called the File Transfer Protocol.

59
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.595
إنه مختلف قليلاً

60
00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:33.410
When you see HTTP,

61
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.730
it's expecting that you're going to give back and forth HTML5 code;

62
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.815
with FTP, it could be any type of file.

63
00:03:40.815 --> 00:03:42.869
So, we have the protocol,

64
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.220
now let's talk about what the domain names represent.

65
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.870
Usually, the domain names are something recognizable, such as umich.edu,

66
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.875
would be for University of Michigan.

67
00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:56.280
Google.com, wikipedia.org.

68
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.575
So, each of these sites has a different top-level domain.

69
00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:01.940
How did you get them?

70
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.445
How do some people get to be.edu and some.com, some.biz, et cetera?

71
00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:10.900
Well, they're actually determined by ICANN.

72
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.985
Their job is to go in and decide which types of

73
00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:17.060
organizations qualify for different domains.

74
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.950
I've included a link here if you want,

75
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.785
you can go and see what the different types are.

76
00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:24.230
But the important thing to know is that

77
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.765
your domain name is actually mapped to an address.

78
00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:32.480
In the old days, like when my Dad was on the Internet,

79
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.060
if he want to connect to some place,

80
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.635
he would actually type in numbers;

81
00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:39.565
185.261 et cetera, et cetera.

82
00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:42.815
Well, there's been a new version of IP addresses,

83
00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.860
because every single client needs their own address.

84
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.505
If you think of how many people have laptops and smartphones,

85
00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:51.580
we need a lot of different options.

86
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.850
So, with these IP addresses,

87
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.195
you basically have sets of numbers,

88
00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:01.400
you have these different sets right here,

89
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.660
where each X can represent one of 16 different values.

90
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.820
So, you can see we have a lot of options,

91
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.580
over 300 trillion, in fact.

92
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.810
As I said, luckily for you,

93
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.435
the domain name server lets you type in something really simple like Umich or Google,

94
00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:22.435
and it's the one that turns it into that really long number.

95
00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:26.320
The last part of your URL is the document.

96
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.760
So, sometimes you want to specify a very specific document that you want to get.

97
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.215
So, for instance, the contact page,

98
00:05:34.215 --> 00:05:36.035
or in this case,

99
00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:39.760
another one I have the file that's inside a folder.

100
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.430
But sometimes you don't put a document at all.

101
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.835
In fact, most of the time, you don't.

102
00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:49.630
If you type in wikipedia.org or Facebook.com,

103
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.360
there's no filename. But that's okay.

104
00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:01.465
Every server has a default document that it's going to return.

105
00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:05.180
Usually, it's called index.HTML.

106
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.875
All right. So, we figured it out.

107
00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.880
We know what it means when we're typing something in.

108
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.650
We understand the request.

109
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.070
What happens though once we type that in,

110
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.805
is we are actually going to get back a lot of information.

111
00:06:19.805 --> 00:06:22.340
Headers, cookies, form data,

112
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.815
all the stuff that you don't see.

113
00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:30.805
So, the important thing to know is that the server returns files, not web pages.

114
00:06:30.805 --> 00:06:33.000
For a lot of us, we are very visual.

115
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.500
So, when we type in a URL,

116
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.715
we're looking and we're like,

117
00:06:35.715 --> 00:06:37.390
"Oh, here's my page."

118
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.890
But sometimes the browser might be returning

119
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.635
something for different types of screen readers,

120
00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:46.665
assistive technology, so it's not returning a web page,

121
00:06:46.665 --> 00:06:49.205
it's returning lots and lots of files.

122
00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:54.875
Hopefully, I will admit that sometimes the server can't fulfill the request.

123
00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:57.500
If it can't, it'll send back an error code.

124
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.590
I think a lot of you are familiar with 404,

125
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.405
where it says, "File not found."

126
00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:05.105
That usually means you typed something in wrong.

127
00:07:05.105 --> 00:07:07.220
If you get a 500 error,

128
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.170
that actually means that the servers down.

129
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.810
So, you may as well go have a snack,

130
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.585
do something fun, come back later and type it in again.

131
00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:21.110
So, I want to do a live demo with you of what happens when we type something in.

132
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.850
So, I've written it down for you.

133
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.825
It looks up the domain,

134
00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:27.520
the DNS returns an IP address,

135
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.440
and then a whole bunch of files start to be returned. Let's take a look.

136
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.120
What I've done here is I've gone to the school of

137
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.595
information site at the University of Michigan.

138
00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:41.720
I simply typed in si.umich.edu.

139
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.945
I didn't type in the protocol because it usually just defaults.

140
00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:48.285
So, what you see here visually is a page.

141
00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:51.540
Student looking out, looking very inspired, et cetera.

142
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.120
But now, I'm going to do a little trick here,

143
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.650
where I right-click on the screen,

144
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.329
and I'm going to choose the option that says, "Inspect."

145
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.255
A window's going to pop up to the side here.

146
00:08:07.255 --> 00:08:08.950
I'm going to say, "You know what?

147
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.410
I would like to see all the information that's

148
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.200
being returned when I actually request this page."

149
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.985
I'm requesting one page, I'm going to hit "Refresh."

150
00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:18.730
If you look off to the side,

151
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.890
don't worry that you can't see the details.

152
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:27.880
But you should see that the single page is actually made up of lots and lots of files,

153
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.920
and each one of these files was a separate request.

154
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.745
Okay. So, let's review.

155
00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:34.805
This was a long video,

156
00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:37.690
where really all I want you to come away from it with is

157
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.945
the knowledge that every URL has those three parts;

158
00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:44.225
the protocol, the domain, and the document.

159
00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:49.340
Realize that what you're creating is bigger than just one file at a time.

160
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.850
Every request-response cycle is usually lots and

161
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.610
lots of rounds of communication between the client and the server.

162
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.210
So, we're going to start off small.

163
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.260
We're going to do one file at a time,

164
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:05.690
but you can always look ahead to building bigger and bigger web applications.
